 ## Assumptions & Clarifications
- What assumptions made by the team that were confirmed
  - Law firms currently do not use a standardized or unified software system for consultation and case management.
  - Manual scheduling of consultations and hearings is common practice.
  - Client confidentiality is a critical requirement and must be strictly maintained.
  - Role-based access control is necessary due to different responsibilities of lawyers, interns,   and administrators.
  - Informal communication tools such as WhatsApp are widely used for client–lawyer interaction.

Billing practices vary across lawyers and are not uniformly standardized.
- What assumptions that were corrected 
  - We initially assumed that some scheduling tools might already be in use; however, scheduling is largely handled through personal diaries or manual notes.
  - It was assumed that billing structures are generally consistent, but in practice, billing methods differ significantly (per-hearing vs lump-sum).

  - We assumed English-only interfaces might be sufficient; the expert clarified the importance of regional language support for accessibility.

  - It was assumed that all documents are systematically archived; in reality, documents are often scattered or misplaced.

- Open questions that need follow-up 
  - What is the minimum document retention period required in practice?
  - How should long periods of client or lawyer inactivity be handled by the system?
