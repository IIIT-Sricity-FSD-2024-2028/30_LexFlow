## Problem Statement

### Introduction

The legal industry continues to rely on fragmented systems for client interaction and internal case handling. Clients face difficulties in identifying suitable legal professionals, scheduling consultations, securely sharing documents, and tracking case progress. Law firms, on the other hand, struggle with managing consultations, cases, documents, hearings, and billing using disconnected tools or manual workflows.

This project proposes a **Unified Digital Platform** that integrates **online legal consultation services** with a **Law Firm Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system**, enabling seamless management of the complete legal service lifecycle—from initial client consultation to case resolution.

###  Objectives

- Provide a single platform for clients to consult legal professionals online
- Automate the conversion of consultations into structured legal cases
- Digitize law firm operations including case, document, and hearing management
- Ensure secure, role-based access to sensitive legal data
- Improve transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in legal services
